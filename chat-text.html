                        <p class="default-paragraph">
                            The BMW X4 has always been a unique entry into the luxury SUV market, positioning itself as a **sports
                            activity coupe**. In 2017, the BMW X4 continued to impress with its blend of dynamic performance,
                            distinctive styling, and luxurious features. This year marked a period where two generations of the X4 were
                            available, allowing buyers to explore both the newer model's enhancements and the tried-and-tested features
                            of the earlier iteration.
                        </p>
                
                        <p class="default-heading-5">Distinctive Design</p>
                
                        <p class="default-paragraph">
                            The exterior design of the 2017 BMW X4 embodies a striking balance between muscularity and elegance. With
                            its **sloping roofline** and pronounced wheel arches, the X4 presents a sporty yet sophisticated aesthetic.
                            The signature BMW kidney grille sits prominently at the front, flanked by sharp, **sweeping headlights**
                            that give the vehicle an assertive presence on the road.
                        </p>
                
                
                        <p class="default-paragraph">
                            The coupe-like silhouette is accentuated by the rear-end design, featuring LED taillights and a sculpted
                            bumper. This design not only enhances aerodynamics but also contributes to its sporty profile. The X4's
                            **wheelbase** is slightly longer than that of the X3, providing a more stable and planted feel during
                            drives. <span class="default-strong">Overall, the 2017 BMW X4</span> is an eye-catching vehicle that stands
                            apart from traditional SUVs.
